if roll of 1, all accumulated points for that roll are lost (eg, dont save points till after player submits rolls [aka "hold"])

if >=100, player wins

points are added each time they roll

will need roll function

a function for storing added values, then later added to player score. something like function= otherFunction + new roll;
return other function + new roll

and

function "hold" = otherFunction + function;

need two player, player vs ai:easy(always quits after second roll) player vs ai:hard(uses logic to make decisions)

hard ai logic:
stop after 3 rolls if score is greater than or equal to 10. otherwise, roll again.
